# TaskVisualizer
Simple interactive visualization of running processes.

Uses Python 2.7, PyQt, psutil (to get the system processes)

It visualizes processes graphically. Every process is a circle. The radius of the circle represents CPU usage and the position on the y axis represents memory usage.

Currently, the bigger the radius, the more CPU usage. And the lower on the y-axis, the more memory usage.
